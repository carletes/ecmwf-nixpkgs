# A development environment for working with Magics in Python

After activating this development shell (manually with `nix develop`,
or automatically if you have [direnv][] installed), you should be able
to run the sample Pythin script `sample-plot.py`, which generates a Magics plot:

```
$ python3 sample-plot.py
$ ls -l magics.png 
-rw-r--r-- 1 carlos users 205818 Dec 31 17:56 magics.png
$
```
